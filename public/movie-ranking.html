    <h1>The Best Movies</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>ratatouille</h3>
    <p>Ratatouille is a cinematic masterpiece that dives into the whimsical world of gourmet cuisine prepared by a rodent connoisseur, Remy.
    It's not just about the rats in chef hats, though that's a spectacle itself, but the way it makes you believe in the impossible.
    Who knew a rat could whip up a better soup than a seasoned chef? Or that you'd leave the theater contemplating if a ratatouille prepared by a rodent is the newest Michelin Star worthy dish?
    This movie doesn’t just stay with you; it scurries around in your heart long after the credits roll, with the lighthearted humor and a rat's determination to cook making it a hearty meal for the soul.<br>
    5/5✰</p>


    <h3>Harry Potter 3: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
    <p>This installment of the Harry Potter series takes us on a whimsical ride through a world where magic is as cool as the other side of the pillow.
    However, it seems the true magic was in the sultry glances and the mysterious aura of Professor Snape, who, to the disappointment of fans everywhere, wasn't around much to cast spells on our hearts.
    The lack of our beloved shmexy Snape left a void no Patronus could fill. Amidst the usual magical mayhem, Harry casts spells, stirs trouble, and faces off with the notorious Prisoner of Azkaban, but without Snape’s brooding presence gracing the halls of Hogwarts, it felt like watching a Quidditch match without the Snitch.
    A spellbinding adventure, but with less Snape to swoon over, it's a bit of a bummer.</br>
    3/5✰</p>


    <h3>Armageddon</h3>
    <p>The movie Armageddon is a roller-coaster of emotions, led by the bald and bold Bruce Willis, whose shiny dome is only outshined by his stellar acting.
        He's not just a hero; he's the bald hero we never knew we needed.
        The musical score is a high note, especially the goosebump-inducing "I Don't Want to Close My Eyes" song that makes you want to stand up and salute every asteroid-busting action.
        However, the movie hits a rocky patch with its premise of menacing space rocks threatening Earth. It's common knowledge that space is a rock-free zone (duh!), making the whole scenario a tad too fictional for my taste.
        Despite the far-fetched rocky menace, Bruce's bald brilliance and the epic soundtrack almost make up for the geological goof-up in the cosmos. It's a head-banging, heart-thumping ride, but the rocky road drops it to a</br>
